Pricingch.art uses token-based authentication. You can generate a token for your project from the `API Keys` tab of your project.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
```

## API Keys

API key tokens are used to authenticate requests to the Pricingch.art API. You can generate a token for your project from the `API Keys` tab of your project. You can create 5 API tokens per project. Each token can be used to access the plans and features of the project. If the token is revoked or deleted from the project, it will no longer be able to access the project's plans and features.
