## Setting up

- The first step is to create a pricingch.art account if you haven't created one yet. Head over to [app.pricingch.art](https://app.pricingch.art) and create an account.
- Next create a new project. Once you have created a project, you will be redirected to the project details page.
- Start adding your plans and features. You can add as many plans and features as you want.
- Once you have added your plans and features, go to the `API Keys` tab to create an API key. You will need this API key to access your plans and features.
- And Voila! You are all set to use the API in your application.

Example API call to get all plans:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.pricingch.art/public/plans/all \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```

Please visit the [API Reference](/api-reference) section to learn more about the API.
